🌍 Australia Schools Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project provides an analytical view of the Australian education sector, focusing on schools, students, and staff distribution. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to explore key metrics such as school numbers by sector, student enrollments, and staff allocation across different states and territories over the years.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

Total number of schools categorized by sector (Government, Catholic, Independent)

Student enrollments by sector, gender, and state

Staff distribution across different education sectors

Trends over time in schools, students, and staff allocation
