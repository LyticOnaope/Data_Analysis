# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to uncover key trends, identify high-risk areas, and suggest possible safety improvements. Using **Microsoft Excel**, we created an **interactive dashboard** to visualize accident trends, severity levels, and influencing factors.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- **Total casualties** recorded in accidents
- **Severity levels** (fatal, serious, slight injuries)
- **Vehicle types involved**
- **Accidents by road type & location**
- **Lighting & road surface conditions**
- **Monthly trends of accidents**

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Total Casualties & Severity Levels
- 🚨 **266,492 total casualties** recorded.
- **Severity Breakdown:**
  - **Fatal:** 4,279 (1.6%)
  - **Serious:** 36,941 (13.9%)
  - **Slight:** 225,272 (84.5%)
- **Insight:** Most accidents result in minor injuries, but serious and fatal accidents remain a concern.

### 2️⃣ Casualties by Vehicle Type
- 🚗 **Cars account for 79.8% of casualties (212,594).**
- 🚌 **Buses (78,985 casualties) and motorcycles (21,996) also contribute significantly.**
- 🚜 Agricultural vehicles recorded the lowest casualties (517).
- **Insight:** Cars contribute the most to accidents, highlighting the need for awareness campaigns.

### 3️⃣ Monthly Trend Analysis
- 📈 **Casualties peak in mid-year (June - August).**
- **December shows a slight drop, likely due to safer holiday measures.**
- **Insight:** Increased traffic in mid-year may be a contributing factor to accidents.

### 4️⃣ Casualties by Road Type
- 🛣️ **Single carriageways account for most casualties (196,086).**
- 🛤️ Roundabouts (17%) and dual carriageways (4.7%) also contribute significantly.
- **Insight:** Single carriageways require enhanced road safety measures.

### 5️⃣ Casualties by Location
- 🌆 **Urban areas:** 33.75%
- 🌳 **Rural areas:** 66.25%
- **Insight:** Higher rural casualties indicate dangerous road conditions, poor infrastructure, or lack of emergency services.

### 6️⃣ Casualties by Lighting & Road Surface Conditions
- 🌞 **Daylight accidents (77.71%)** outnumber night-time accidents.
- 🌙 **Darkness-related accidents account for 22.29%.**
- 🌧️ **Wet roads contribute significantly (71,957 casualties).**
- ❄️ **Snowy conditions lead to 12,398 casualties.**
- **Insight:** Daytime accidents are more common due to higher traffic, but night driving remains a safety risk.

## 🎯 Recommendations
1. **Increase road safety awareness for car users** (since they contribute the most casualties).
2. **Improve infrastructure in rural areas** to reduce accident rates.
3. **Enhance road lighting** and visibility for night-time safety.
4. **Introduce stricter safety measures on single carriageways**.
5. **Encourage cautious driving on wet and slippery roads**.

## 💻 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Dashboard Creation)

## 📌 Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights for improving road safety. By implementing better road infrastructure, awareness programs, and enhanced driving policies, we can help reduce road accidents and save lives.
